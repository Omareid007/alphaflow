You are working on an AI trading MVP. Read this carefully and then propose a plan with specific files you will edit before changing any code.

Context:

There is an existing “New Strategy” configuration flow in the frontend.

The current strategies Range Trading, Momentum, Mean Reversion, Breakout are dummy placeholders. They must remain in the UI list but their configuration flows can stay as simple stubs.

The only real strategy we want to wire right now is the Moving Average Crossover (SMA) strategy implemented in code.

Real strategy implementation:

Strategy config + backtest logic is in moving-average-crossover.ts (imported as "../strategies/moving-average-crossover").

AI validation logic is in ai-strategy-validator.ts, exporting:

validateMovingAverageConfig(config, marketIntelligence?)

getValidatorStatus()

MovingAverageCrossoverConfig, MOVING_AVERAGE_PRESETS, PARAMETER_BOUNDS, and STRATEGY_SCHEMA are already defined there.

Do not rewrite these engines:

AIDecisionEngine

DataFusionEngine

Goal:

Wire the real Moving Average Crossover strategy into the New Strategy flow, while keeping the dummy strategies as shallow placeholders.

Detailed requirements:

Strategy selection

In the “New Strategy” screen, when the user selects the Moving Average Crossover strategy (id: moving_average_crossover, name from STRATEGY_SCHEMA), route them into a new dedicated wizard for this strategy.

Keep Range/Momentum/Mean Reversion/Breakout in the list, but their flows can remain dummy/simple. Do not remove them.

Wizard steps for Moving Average Crossover

The wizard should be retail-friendly and use presets, not raw SMA numbers:

Step 1 – Select Asset

Use STRATEGY_SCHEMA.supportedSymbols from moving-average-crossover.ts as the dropdown options (e.g., SPY, QQQ, AAPL, etc.).

Store the selected symbol in a local strategy config state.

Step 2 – Select Risk Profile (Preset)

Show three options based on MOVING_AVERAGE_PRESETS:

Conservative

Balanced

Aggressive

For each option, display:

Name

Description

A short line like “fast/slow SMA: X / Y, allocation: Z%, risk limit: W%”.

When the user picks a preset, fill the local config state with the preset values:

fastPeriod

slowPeriod

allocationPct

riskLimitPct

Do not expose raw SMA fields for manual tweaking in this MVP.

Step 3 – Summary + AI Strategy Validation

Show a read-only summary of:

Strategy name (“Moving Average Crossover (SMA)”)

Selected symbol

Selected preset (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)

Effective parameters (fast/slow periods, allocation %, risk limit %)

Add a button: “Run AI Strategy Check”.

When clicking this button:

Call the backend endpoint /api/strategy-config to store the config (using the final symbol + preset values).

Call /api/strategy-validate which wraps validateMovingAverageConfig() from ai-strategy-validator.ts.

Pass a MovingAverageCrossoverConfig object; the backend should call normalizeMovingAverageConfig before validation.

Display the AI result in a panel with:

summary

riskAssessment

parameterFeedback (render as bullet list)

suitability (e.g., tag/chip: retail_friendly / borderline / advanced_only)

confidence (e.g., numeric or simple “Confidence: 0.83”)

Backend integration

If not already present, add minimal backend endpoints:

POST /api/strategy-config

Accepts a partial MovingAverageCrossoverConfig (symbol + selected preset).

Uses normalizeMovingAverageConfig to produce the final config and keeps it in memory for now.

Returns the normalized config.

POST /api/strategy-validate

Accepts the strategy config (or preset id + symbol).

Uses normalizeMovingAverageConfig and then calls validateMovingAverageConfig.

Returns the StrategyValidationResult JSON.

Keep implementations small and focused. Do not change AIDecisionEngine or DataFusionEngine.

General constraints

Preserve the existing routing, layout, and styling of the “New Strategy” flow as much as possible.

Do not delete any existing strategies or engines. We are adding a real path for Moving Average Crossover and keeping the others as stubs for future work.

Keep changes localized and avoid large refactors.

Before writing code:

First, list the files you will modify and summarize the changes you plan in each.

Then apply the changes in small, clear commits/steps.

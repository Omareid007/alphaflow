[TOKENS]
APP_NAME = "Active Trader – Strategy Builder"
MVP_STRATEGY = "Range Trading"
RUN_MODE = "PAPER"              # must be fully functional
REAL_TRADING = "DISABLED"       # placeholder only
EVAL_INTERVAL_SEC = 30
ASSET_UNIVERSE = "Choose easiest real market to support end-to-end"
LLM_PROVIDER = "OpenAI"
DATA_REQUIREMENT = "REAL market data (no mocks)"
NEWS_REQUIREMENT = "REAL news (no mocks)"

[GOAL]
Build a mobile-first app where a user configures an AI trading agent (strategy + goals + risk limits), and the agent continuously:
1) pulls REAL market data,
2) pulls REAL news,
3) uses OpenAI to score opportunities and explain decisions,
4) decides trade / size / timing / skip,
5) executes in PAPER mode with a complete trade ledger, positions, and P&L.

[IMPORTANT]
- Do NOT use mock/synthetic data for the main run. Use real external APIs for both market data and news.
- Keep the implementation flexible: pick whichever APIs/tools/providers are fastest and easiest to integrate on Replit.
- Use adapters so market/news/broker providers can be swapped later without rewriting the app.
- OpenAI must be used for the AI decision engine (analysis/scoring/explanations). Use tool/function calling where helpful to fetch data and compose decisions.

[USER EXPERIENCE]
- Auth: sign up / login.
- Wizard: select strategy (only MVP_STRATEGY must work end-to-end), choose market/universe, optional watchers, set capital + risk controls (SL/TP/max position/max exposure/kill switch), confirm risk disclaimer.
- Run & Monitor: start/stop agent; dashboard shows live status, last decision + reason, open positions, P&L, and decision/trade logs.
- History: all paper trades, timestamps, and key metrics.
- Admin console: configure AI “profiles” (which OpenAI model per role), and a simple orchestration sequence (which role runs first/next).

[SAFETY + SECURITY]
- Treat this as “not financial advice.”
- Keep OpenAI and external API keys server-side only (never in client/mobile code). Use environment secrets. Add minimal rate-limit + retry handling.
- REAL trading remains disabled in MVP, but architecture should allow plugging it in later.

[SUCCESS CRITERIA]
- End-to-end demo works with REAL market data + REAL news + OpenAI scoring.
- A user can configure an agent, run it, and see explainable decisions and paper trades updating over time.
- Admin changes (model selection / orchestration order) affect subsequent decisions.
- Provide a short README documenting which real APIs you chose and why (ease, reliability, free tier), and how to set secrets.

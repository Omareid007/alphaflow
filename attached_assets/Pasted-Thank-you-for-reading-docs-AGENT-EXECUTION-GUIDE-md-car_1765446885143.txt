Thank you for reading docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md carefully.

Here are definitive answers to your questions and how I want you to proceed:

1) FILE LOCATION FOR THE GUIDE  
Yes, the correct and final location for the governance document is:
- docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md

If it is not already there, save it there. This is the canonical path and MUST NOT change.

2) MISSING REFERENCED DOCUMENTS  
Yes, you MUST create and maintain the following documentation files as part of our documentation system:

- docs/FINANCIAL_METRICS.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/TESTING.md

Use the instructions and templates implied by:
- docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md
- docs/APP_OVERVIEW.md

For now:
- Create **full, meaningful first versions** of these docs, NOT empty stubs.
- Focus on what is actually implemented in this repo right now.
- If some sections are “not implemented yet”, explicitly label them as such instead of guessing.

3) INTEGRATION WITH APP_OVERVIEW.md  
Yes, I want the documents cross-linked in a simple, clean way:

- In docs/APP_OVERVIEW.md, add a short subsection (e.g. “Related Documentation”) that links to:
  - docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md
  - docs/FINANCIAL_METRICS.md
  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - docs/TESTING.md

- In docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md, keep the reference to docs/APP_OVERVIEW.md as the main “map” of the app.

So:
- They should remain separate documents with clear responsibilities,
- BUT they should cross-reference each other so future agents and engineers always find them.

4) LOGGING UTILITY  
For now, **do NOT** create a full-blown logging framework as part of this task. The current approach using console.log with prefixes is acceptable as a temporary baseline.

HOWEVER:
- When you work on observability, SRE, or error handling tasks later, you SHOULD refactor to a small logging utility that:
  - centralises formatting,
  - supports log levels (info/warn/error),
  - and avoids logging secrets.

For this current documentation-focused task, you can:
- Simply document the current logging approach in the architecture/observability docs,
- And optionally add a small TODO section about improving logging in the future.

5) ENFORCEMENT SCOPE  
The guide applies to:

- **All future work from this point forward**, and  
- **Any existing code you TOUCH during a task.**

You are NOT required to proactively audit the entire codebase right now purely for compliance. However:

- Whenever you modify existing code, you MUST:
  - Bring it closer to the standards in docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md (tests, docs, safety).
  - Avoid introducing new patterns that conflict with the guide.

Think of this as:
- “Forward-looking enforcement” + “Boy scout rule”:
  - Leave every part you touch in a better state than you found it.

NOW, NEXT STEP:
After applying the above decisions, your next task is:

- Confirm docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md is in place at the correct path.
- Then proceed to create and populate:
  - docs/FINANCIAL_METRICS.md
  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - docs/TESTING.md

Use the instructions and templates implied by our previous conversation and by the execution guide.

In your next reply, please:
- Confirm file paths,
- Briefly list what you plan to do for each of the three docs (one or two bullets per doc),
- Then execute that plan end-to-end (implement, add tests if needed, update docs), following AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.

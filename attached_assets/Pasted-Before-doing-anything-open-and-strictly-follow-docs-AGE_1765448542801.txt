TASK: Logging & Observability Baseline

Act as:
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- Backend Engineer
- Technical Writer

Goal:
Introduce a small, consistent logging utility and basic observability for backend/orchestrator flows, without over-engineering and without changing external behaviour.

Scope:
- Replace ad-hoc console.log usage in backend/orchestrator with a central logging helper.
- Add log levels (info, warn, error) and a minimal correlation identifier (e.g. requestId / cycleId).
- Document the logging strategy clearly.

Steps:
1. Analyse current logging usage:
   - Identify key files (API handlers, orchestrator, broker integration) where console.log is used.
2. Create a simple logging utility:
   - e.g. `server/utils/logger.(ts|js)`
   - Functions: `logInfo`, `logWarn`, `logError` (or similar).
   - Each log should include:
     - `level`
     - `context` (module or area, e.g. "orchestrator", "alpaca", "api")
     - `message`
     - Optional `meta` object for extra details.
3. Refactor critical paths:
   - Replace raw console.log calls in critical backend/orchestrator files with the new logger.
   - Keep messages meaningful but not verbose.
4. Correlation IDs (minimal):
   - If possible, introduce a simple correlation ID for:
     - Incoming HTTP requests.
     - Orchestrator cycles.
   - Pass it through log calls so related logs can be grouped.
5. Safety:
   - NEVER log secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials).
   - Avoid logging full request bodies unless necessary; log only key identifiers.
6. Documentation:
   - Create or update docs/OBSERVABILITY.md with:
     - The logging format and levels.
     - Where logs are emitted from (API, orchestrator, broker integration).
     - Guidelines for future engineers on what/how to log.
   - Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md “Observability” section to mention the logging approach.

Final response:
- Summarise what changed and in which files.
- Show a short example of the new log output format.
- List any remaining TODOs (e.g. future metrics/tracing integration).

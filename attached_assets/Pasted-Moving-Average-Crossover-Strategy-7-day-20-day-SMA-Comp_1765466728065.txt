Moving Average Crossover Strategy (7-day/20-day SMA)
Composite Score: 13.92
Performance Metrics
•Annual Return: +21.0%
•Sharpe Ratio: 0.8689
•Maximum Drawdown: -57.58%
•Benchmark Comparison: Beat S&P 500 by 9.7% annually (Strategy: +21.0% vs S&P 500: +11.3% CAGR)
•Backtest Period: 2014-2024 (10 years)
Description
This classic trend-following strategy uses a short-term (7-day) and medium-term (20-day) simple moving average crossover system. Buy signals are generated when the 7-day SMA crosses above the 20-day SMA, indicating upward momentum. Sell signals occur when the 7-day SMA crosses below the 20-day SMA. While the strategy shows impressive returns over a 10-year period, the significant maximum drawdown of -57.58% indicates that it can experience substantial losses during volatile or sideways markets.

Description
The Cumulative RSI strategy enhances the traditional Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator by accumulating RSI values over time to identify sustained overbought and oversold conditions. This approach filters out short-term noise and focuses on longer-term momentum reversals. The 25-year backtest period provides strong evidence of strategy robustness across multiple market cycles, including the dot-com crash, financial crisis, and recent market volatility.

Enhance AI Trades Screen
TASK: Add pipeline visibility to AISuggestedTradesScreen

CONTEXT:
- Currently shows decisions without execution context
- Need to show: Decision -> Risk Gate -> Order -> Fill -> Position -> Exit
- Need filters for pipeline status
- Need links to related orders/positions

CHANGES REQUIRED:
1. Create pipeline timeline component:
   - Visual stages with status indicators
   - Timestamps and details per stage
   - Color coding: green(completed), yellow(pending), red(failed)

2. Enhance decision cards:
   - Add pipeline timeline row
   - Add "View Order" button when orderId exists
   - Add "View Position" button when position exists
   - Show consensus info if parallel mode used

3. Add new filters:
   - "In Pipeline" - decisions with pending orders
   - Enhance existing filters with counts

4. Create API endpoint for enriched decisions:
   - GET /api/ai-decisions/enriched
   - Joins with orders, positions, fills
   - Returns pipeline status per decision

FILES TO MODIFY:
- client/screens/AISuggestedTradesScreen.tsx
- server/routes.ts (add enriched endpoint)
Prompt 5: Database Enrichment Job
TASK: Create job to enrich database with real market data

CONTEXT:
- broker_assets table needs fundamentals
- universe_technicals needs daily calculation
- macro_indicators needs FRED data

CHANGES REQUIRED:
1. Create server/jobs/enrich-universe.ts:
   - Daily job to fetch fundamentals from FMP/SEC EDGAR
   - Calculate technical indicators from Alpaca bars
   - Update broker_assets with sector, market_cap, pe_ratio, etc.

2. Create server/jobs/update-technicals.ts:
   - Daily job to calculate RSI, MACD, SMA, etc.
   - Store in universe_technicals table
   - Run after market close

3. Create server/jobs/sync-macro.ts:
   - Daily job to fetch FRED indicators
   - Update macro_indicators table
   - Key series: DGS10, FEDFUNDS, CPIAUCSL, VIX

4. Add cron scheduling:
   - Enrich universe: 6 AM UTC daily
   - Update technicals: 9 PM UTC daily (after US close)
   - Sync macro: 7 AM UTC daily

FILES TO CREATE:
- server/jobs/enrich-universe.ts
- server/jobs/update-technicals.ts
- server/jobs/sync-macro.ts
- server/jobs/scheduler.ts
Prompt 6: Configure Autonomous Trading (75% Threshold)
TASK: Configure autonomous trading with 75% confidence auto-execute threshold

CONTEXT:
- User wants aggressive autonomous mode
- Auto-execute trades when AI confidence >= 75%
- Parallel consensus is DISABLED for faster execution
- Claude Max is primary provider with free fallbacks

CHANGES REQUIRED:
1. Update server/autonomous/orchestrator.ts:
   - Set autoExecuteThreshold = 75
   - Add mode switching: 'manual' | 'semi-auto' | 'full-auto'
   - When full-auto AND confidence >= 75%, execute without approval
   - Log all auto-executed trades for audit

2. Add admin controls:
   - Toggle between manual/semi-auto/full-auto modes
   - Adjustable confidence threshold (default 75%)
   - Max trades per hour limit
   - Allowed strategies for auto-execution

3. Update UI:
   - Show current mode in Dashboard
   - Show auto-execution indicator on trades
   - Admin panel for mode configuration

4. Safety rails:
   - Kill switch always available
   - Daily loss limit still enforced
   - Max position limits respected
   - All auto-trades logged with reasoning

Build a full-stack mobile app called “Active Trader – Strategy Builder”.
Purpose:
Let a user build an AI-assisted active trading agent through a step-by-step configuration wizard, then run it in virtual mode, with a dashboard for monitoring decisions, P&L and backtests.
Overall concept
The app should implement this user journey as a multi-step wizard:
Select Strategy
User chooses one strategy from a list:
Range Trading (fully implemented in MVP)
Momentum Algo (placeholder)
Mean Reversion (placeholder)
Pairs Trading (placeholder)
Breakout Trading (placeholder)
Fundamental / Company-specific (placeholder)
Only Range Trading needs to actually work end-to-end; others can be disabled or marked “Coming Soon”.
Confirm Strategy Understanding & Risk
Show a strategy description and risk explanation for the selected strategy.
Example copy for Range Trading:
“Range Trading places buy/sell orders near support/resistance bands derived from historical price ranges. If the range breaks, losses can be amplified.”
User must tick a checkbox: “I understand how this strategy works and accept the associated risks.”
Only after confirming can they proceed.
Market / Stock Suitability
Show a list of markets to apply the strategy to, e.g.:
ADX
DFM
NYSE
NASDAQ
Crypto
For the selected strategy, mark each market as:
Recommended – if liquidity/volume/market structure are suitable.
Not Recommended – with a short reason (e.g. “Low liquidity / limited order types for this strategy”).
User chooses one primary market or a specific symbol (simplify to choosing market only in MVP if needed).
Trigger Markets / Watchers Layer
User optionally selects trigger / watcher markets that influence the agent’s decisions.
Example:
Primary market: ADX
Trigger/watchers: Oil price, NASDAQ, Crypto
Display simple guidance such as:
“ADX and NYSE: historically correlated – recommended as triggers.”
“Crypto vs ADX: no strong correlation – high risk if used as trigger.”
For MVP, it is enough if the triggers are stored and shown in the config; the logic can be simple.
Input Strategy Factors – Range Trading Config
For Range Trading, user sets:
Range band (%) e.g. 2%
Number of historical days to define the range (e.g. 14 / 30)
Check interval (seconds) – how often the agent evaluates the market
These parameters will later drive the decision logic.
Adaptive Strategy – Macro & Context Factors
Separate step to define how the strategy adapts to recent conditions.
Let the user choose:
Time window to look back at macro or market conditions:
Past 14 days / 30 days / 90 days
Macro/context factors to consider (checkboxes):
Fed meetings
Oil price trend
Crypto market movement
Regional tensions
GDP / macro sentiment
Show a simple summary rule, for example:
“If last 14-day oil price is up, increase position size in correlated markets.”
For MVP, the logic can be simplified: treat this as a multiplier on position size or risk appetite (e.g. +X% / -X%).
Allocate Amount (Capital Allocation)
User inputs total amount in AED they want to allocate to this agent.
Example: “Allocate 25,000 AED to this strategy.”
Set Exposure per Position
User defines how much to risk per position, in:
Fixed AED amount per position or
% of allocated capital
Also allow a simple adaptive toggle like:
“Allow agent to increase/decrease exposure by X% based on adaptive strategy signals.”
Control Limits
User sets risk limits for the agent:
Limit type and frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).
Max loss amount (AED or %).
Take Profit level (AED or %).
Stop Loss level (per position or global).
These are guardrails the agent must respect.
Backtest Strategy
User can run a backtest / simulation of the current configuration:
Choose a simulation period (e.g. 14 days, 6 months, 1 year, or “Skip”).
The system runs the strategy logic over historical or synthetic data and returns:
Final P&L
Basic stats (win rate, max drawdown – can be approximated).
Show results on a simple chart + summary.
Execute – Virtual vs Real (MVP = Virtual only)
Final step: choose execution mode:
Virtual / Paper Trading (active in MVP)
Real Trading (disabled / placeholder, labelled “Future – requires full integration, compliance, legal, fail-safes”).
When user starts the agent in virtual mode:
The agent begins listening to market data.
Decisions and simulated trades are logged.
Daily Reports & Validation
Provide a screen/tab where the user can see for each agent:
Actions taken (with timestamps and prices).
Reason / strategy decision (e.g. “Price hit lower band – opened long”).
P&L timeline.
Whether any limits were hit (max daily loss, etc.).
Architecture – Agents & Orchestrator (backend)
On the backend, structure the logic conceptually around four roles:
Listener agent
Periodically pulls market prices (and optionally macro/trigger data).
Subscribes to primary market + any selected trigger/watchers.
Decider agent
Applies the chosen strategy rules (in MVP: Range Trading) plus adaptive factors.
Uses the config from the wizard: band %, historical days, triggers, exposure, limits.
Outputs decisions: HOLD, OPEN_LONG, CLOSE, STOP_AGENT.
Executor agent
For MVP, performs virtual execution only:
Opens/closes simulated positions.
Updates P&L and position state.
No real orders, but code should be organized so that real execution could be plugged in later.
Orchestrator agent
Coordinates Listener, Decider, Executor for each configured agent.
Stores agent config, status (Running / Stopped / Simulation), positions, P&L and logs in memory.
Exposes a simple REST API to the frontend:
Create/update agent config.
Start/stop agent.
Get current status and logs.
Run a backtest and return the summary.
You don’t have to implement complex real data integrations – a simple mock or synthetic data feed is enough as long as the interfaces and flow are clear.
Frontend – Wizard + Dashboard
Frontend should be a React single-page app with:
A multi-step wizard implementing steps 1–11 above.
A final dashboard where the user can:
See all configured agents in a list (strategy, market, status, P&L).
Start/stop agents.
Click into an agent to see:
Current config summary.
Live status (Running / Stopped, mode: Virtual).
Current P&L and position.
A rolling log of recent decisions/trades.
View a simple chart for backtest or current P&L.
Design:
Keep it clean, minimal, “internal tool” style but polished enough for a boardroom demo. No need for advanced design frameworks; basic CSS or a light UI library is fine.
Priorities
The wizard flow must follow the step order above.
Only Range Trading needs to be fully implemented end-to-end in MVP.
Agent roles (Listener, Decider, Executor, Orchestrator) should be clearly separated in the backend code, even if implementations are simple.
Everything can run in memory; no database is required for the MVP.
Real trading is explicitly disabled – virtual/simulation only.
Focus on a smooth, working end-to-end app that demonstrates:
configurable strategy agents,
multi-step setup,
live/simulated execution loop,
and daily report / logs.
